- ✅ Status: **Applied to website/style.css**

### 3. **Rice Validation System** 🌾
- 🔍 **Intelligent Detection**:
  - Confidence threshold check (< 30% = not rice)
  - Ambiguity detection (low prediction variance)
  - Clear error messages for users
- ⚠️ **User-Friendly Errors**:
  - "Low confidence. This doesn't appear to be a rice leaf image."
  - "Image is ambiguous. Please upload a clear rice leaf image."
  - Helpful suggestions included
- 🔧 **Backend Implementation**:
  - Added `is_rice_leaf()` validation function
  - Returns error before processing invalid images
  - Saves unnecessary computation
- 🎨 **Frontend Integration**:
  - Enhanced error display for validation failures
  - Shows warning icon and helpful message
  - Maintains smooth user experience

## 🚀 How to Test

### Test Rice Validation:
1. Upload a non-rice image (e.g., cat, car, person)
2. System should reject with message: "Low confidence. This doesn't appear to be a rice leaf image."
3. Upload an ambiguous/blurry image
4. System should reject with: "Image is ambiguous. Please upload a clear rice leaf image."
5. Upload a clear rice disease image
6. System should process normally and show results

### Test Paper Styling:
1. Open `paper.html` in browser
2. Observe gradient blue background
3. Hover over layer boxes, metric cards, tables
4. Notice smooth animations and effects
5. Scroll through document to see all sections

### Test Website Background:
1. Visit http://localhost:5000
2. Observe light blue gradient background
3. Check consistency across all sections

## 📊 Technical Details

### Rice Validation Logic:
```python
def is_rice_leaf(img_array, predictions):
    max_confidence = float(np.max(predictions[0]))
    
    # Confidence check
    if max_confidence < 0.30:
        return False, "Low confidence..."
    
    # Ambiguity check
    prediction_std = float(np.std(predictions[0]))
    if prediction_std < 0.10:
        return False, "Image is ambiguous..."
    
    return True, "Valid rice leaf detected"
```

### Color Scheme:
- Primary: #4fc3f7 (Sky Blue)
- Secondary: #03a9f4, #29b6f6 (Blue shades)
- Light: #e1f5fe, #bbdefb, #e3f2fd (Light blues)
- Dark: #01579b, #0277bd (Dark blues)

## ✨ Result

Your rice disease detection system now:
1. ✅ Has a beautifully styled research paper with gradients and animations
2. ✅ Features light blue gradient backgrounds across the website
3. ✅ Validates uploaded images to ensure they are rice leaves
4. ✅ Provides clear feedback for invalid uploads
5. ✅ Maintains professional appearance and user experience

All improvements are live and ready to use! 🎉
